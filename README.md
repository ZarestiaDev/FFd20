# Final Fantasy d20 for Fantasy Grounds Unity
An implementation of the Final Fantasy d20 system (https://www.finalfantasyd20.com/) for Fantasy Grounds Unity (https://www.fantasygrounds.com), based on the built-in Pathfinder 1 and D&D 3.5E implementation.

This ruleset has no in-built data information (e.g. classes, spells, feats, etc.). A separate data module will be needed.
